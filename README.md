# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks
This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the MNIST dataset. The code provided showcases data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and model saving/loading. The code is written in Python using TensorFlow and Matplotlib libraries.

# Prerequisites
- Python (3.6 or later)
- TensorFlow (2.0 or later)
- Matplotlib

# This code contains steps: 
- Load the MNIST dataset.
- Visualize training and testing images.
- Preprocess the data (normalize and reshape).
- Build a CNN model for digit recognition.
- Train the model on the training data.
- Display model summary and architecture visualization.
- Evaluate the model on the testing data and print accuracy.
- Save the trained model to a file.
- Load the saved model and make predictions.
